# Data Expressions

## Purpose

Data is misunderstood by healthcare, tech, and management. 
Data visualization is one way to capture and display multi-dimensional data, which can be distilled as information for the viewers.

The purpose is to ultimately showcase nuances of data using information display technique such as data visualization. 

## About Myself

My name is Jung Hoon Son. I am a medical doctor, informaticist, data engineer, knowledge architect, with a passion for information display. 

Growing up in the U.S. as an immigrant from Korea, I've struggled with expressing my thoughts using a very serialized form of information: language. 

Over time, I felt like I've learned to serialize my thoughts for professional career's sake, but my thoughts are still very dynamic and visual.

I envy writers who can leverage language as a powerful API to connect with the rest of the world, but I also feel that information display techniques like data visualizations can provide additional can help deliver nuanced information in an more accessible manner than text-with-references-at-the-end format.
