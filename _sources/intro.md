## Purpose

The purpose of this website is to ultimately showcase nuances of data using information display technique such as data visualization. 

## About Me

My name is Jung Hoon Son. I am a medical doctor, informaticist, data engineer, knowledge architect, with a passion for information display. 

I often struggled to express my thoughts using a rather strictly serialized form of information, language, as my thoughts tend to be explosively dendritic - very dynamic, branching, and visual. As much as I envy writers who can leverage language as a powerful communication medium, I also feel that information display techniques like data visualizations can reach certain number of population - who think more visually.

I hope to inspire and help people learn data visualization for this very reason.
