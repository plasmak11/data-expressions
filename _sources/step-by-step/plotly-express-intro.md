Altair is a data visualization library that wraps around a JavaScript-based data visualization framework called `vega`. This is why the entirety of Altair's data visualization can be represented in JSON format, to be rendered by vega's Javascript library on any modern browsers.

Vega's goal is to design the grammar and syntax required for portable data visualization.
