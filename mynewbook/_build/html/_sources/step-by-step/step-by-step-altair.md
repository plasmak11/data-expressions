When I was getting my feed wet in data viz, I took a course in data visualization at Columbia University. 

One of the lectures had a beautifully structured, sequential development of a `ggplot2` graph.

Rather than a completed graph, showing that progressive development line-by-line in `RMarkdown` format basically set the foundations that I needed to start my data journey. 

I've not seen many tutorials read this way, and it's likely the reason why ever after 6 years after I've taken that class, not many are fluent in "grammar of graphics". Because showing fully constructed chart is very daunting to break down into parts.
