# Data Expressions

## Purpose

Data is misunderstood by healthcare, tech, and management. 
Data visualization is one way to capture and display multi-dimensional data, which can be distilled as information for the viewers.

The purpose is to ultimately showcase nuances of data using information display technique such as data visualization. 

## About Myself

My name is Jung Hoon Son. I have a passion for information display, as most modern data science mechanisms come short when it comes to expressing and capturing information. 

Growing up, I've struggled with expressing my thoughts using a very serialized form of information: language. I felt that language is a powerful API for connecting with the rest of the world to communicate, but it serves as poor medium for expressing data and information because reader's scope is very variable from word to word.
